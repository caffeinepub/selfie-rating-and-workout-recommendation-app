  "summary": "Frontend branding, rating display hardening, camera fallback messaging, and teen (13+) home-workout copy/plans were updated. Backend scoring logic was modified, but the current rating may still evaluate to 0 given the shown implementation. The requested app icon image update is not evidenced in the diff summary.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Fix the selfie scoring so the returned \"current rating\" is computed correctly (not always 0) while keeping the existing deterministic/explainable scoring approach and the existing API shape (CrossRealityScore with rating, potentialRating, details).",
      "reason": "In the shown backend code, `submitSelfie` always uses `simulatedResults` with 3 items, and `CrossRealityScore.create` computes `score = 3 - results.size()`, which yields 0, making `rating = (score * 10)` equal to 0. This appears to keep returning 0 rather than a meaningful current rating.",
